### Hi there 👋

Software engineer based in Melbourne, Australia.

I'm interested in most aspects of programming. Currently I'm focused on learning about 3D graphics and optimising for performance.

I have worked professionally with Rust, C, and TypeScript, alongside tools such as Docker, SQLite, PostgreSQL, React, and more.
